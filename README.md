# JurasicaDinozauri
A collaborative project aimed at developing 35 web pages for Jurasica Adventure Park in Neptun, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each page featured a detailed description of a dinosaur exhibit, multiple images, and bilingual (Romanian/English) audio narration. These web pages were integrated with QR codes placed at the corresponding exhibits to enhance visitor engagement.

This project was undertaken in collaboration with five colleagues. Below are six selected web pages from the complete set of 35.

All 35 web pages are available on the project coordinator's GitHub: https://github.com/PrimeCalinBefu.
